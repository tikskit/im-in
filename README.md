# The I'm in application

This web application is meetup.comâ€™s analogue (but much better). Some users state that they are going to host events. The event has a number of attributes that help interested people to find it: 
- Description
- Tags that define the nature of the event, what is actually going to happen. For instance yoga workout, group bike ride, pipe smokers meet up, BDSM party, online language lesson etc.
- Slots amount
- Date and time
- Place (address/geo point/web address)
- Price
- etc

Others would like to spend time doing actions they enjoy, together with other people. This is what they use the application for. They set parameters in filters, and the application searches events matching the parameters. If results found the user can claim that they will take part in some of them (which lets the organizers know how many people are going to come and how many empty slots left).
